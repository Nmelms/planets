# Planet Facts Site

Welcome to my planet facts site repo! I created this project as a way to enhance my skills in React and CSS. The design for the app was provided to me in a Figma file, which I then worked on implementing using React.

One of the more challenging aspects of this project was ensuring that each planet had a unique hover color. I was able to solve this issue by setting the color in the JavaScript code. I also had to make sure that the site was fully responsive and provided a great user experience for all visitors. I am very satisfied with the final result and feel that I learned a lot during the development process. 

# How To Use This App
You can view the app by clicking [HERE](https://nmplanets.netlify.app).

Once loaded, mobile users can access the menu by clicking on the hamburger icon in the top right corner of the page. For users on desktop and tablet, the planets will be listed in the navbar at the top of the screen. Simply click on a planet to view a quick fact about it. It's easy to use and a great way to learn about the planets in our solar system. Enjoy!

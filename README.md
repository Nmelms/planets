<h1>Planet Facts Site</h1>

This is a small app I created using React. I was given the design from a Figma file and learned a lot about React and CSS while making this.
One of the hardest parts of this project was making sure all the hover colors for each planet were different for each planet.

<h2>How To Use This App</h2>

Just open the menu, click on a planet, and learn a quick fact.
